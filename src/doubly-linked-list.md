# doubly Linked List

Objectives

1. Construct: a Doubly Linked List

2. Compare and contrast: Doubly and Singly Linked Lists

3. Implement: basic operations on a Doubly Linked List

# 1. What is doubly linked list?

Almost identical to Singly Linked Lists,
except every node has `another pointer`,
to the `previous` node!

# 2. compare with singly linked list

More memory === More Flexibility

It's almost always a tradeoff!

# 3. doubly linked list methods

push, pop, get, set, shift, unshift, remove, insert, reverse

## Push

Adding a node to the end of the Doubly Linked List

```
- Create a new node with the value passed to the function

- If the head property is null set the head and tail to be the newly created node

- If not, set the next property on the tail to be that node

- Set the previous property on the newly created node to be the tail

- Set the tail to be the newly created node

- Increment the length

- Return the Doubly Linked List
```

## Pop

Removing a node from the end of the Doubly Linked List

```
- If there is no head, return undefined

- Store the current tail in a variable to return later

- If the length is 1, set the head and tail to be null

- Update the tail to be the previous Node.

- Set the newTail's next to null

- Decrement the length

- Return the value removed
```

## Shift

Removing a node from the beginning of the Doubly Linked List

```
- If length is 0

    - return undefined

- Store the current head property in a variable (we'll call it old head)

- If the length is one

    - set the head to be null

    - set the tail to be null

- Update the head to be the next of the old head

- Set the head's prev property to null

- Set the old head's next to null

- Decrement the length

- Return old head
```

## Unshift

Adding a node to the beginning of the Doubly Linked List

```
- Create a new node with the value passed to the function

- If the length is 0

    - Set the head to be the new node

    - Set the tail to be the new node

- else

    - Set the prev property on the head of the list to be the new node

    - Set the next property on the new node to be the head property

    - Update the head to be the new node

- Increment the length

- Return the list
```

## Get

Accessing a node in a Doubly Linked List by its position

```
- If the index is less than 0 or greater or equal to the length

    - return null

- If the index is less than or equal to half the length of the list

    - Loop through the list starting from the head and loop towards the middle

    - Return the node once it is found

- If the index is greater than half the length of the list
â€‹
    - Loop through the list starting from the tail and loop towards the middle
    - Return the node once it is found
```

## Set

Replacing the value of a node to the in a Doubly Linked List

```
- Create a variable which is the result of the get method
 at the index passed to the function

- If the get method returns a valid node

    - set the value of that node to be the value passed to the function

    -Return true

- else  return false
```

# Insert

Adding a node in a Doubly Linked List by a certain position

```
- If the index is less than zero or greater than or equal to the length

    - return false

- If the index is 0

    - unshift

- If the index is the same as the length

    - push

- Use the get method to access the index -1

- Set the next and prev properties on the correct nodes
  to link everything together

- Increment the length

- Return true
```

# Remove

Removing a node in a Doubly Linked List by a certain position

```
- If the index is less than zero or greater than or equal to the length

    - return undefined

- If the index is 0

    -shift

- If the index is the same as the length-1

    - pop

- Use the get method to retrieve the item to be removed

- Update the next and prev properties to remove the found node from the list

- Set next and prev to null on the found node

- Decrement the length

- Return the removed node.
```

## Reverse

Reversing a Doubly Linked List in place!

```
- Create a variable called current and set it to be the head of the list

- Create a variable called tail and set it to be the head of the list

- Loop through the list and set the next property of the current node
 to be the prev property of the current node

- If there is no next property, set the tail to be the head
  and the head to be the current variable

- Return the list
```

# Big O of Doubly Linked Lists

Insertion - O(1)

Removal - O(1)

Searching - O(N)

Access - O(N)

Technically searching is O(N / 2), but that's still O(N)

# RECAP

```
Doubly Linked Lists are almost identical to Singly Linked Lists
 except there is an additional pointer to previous nodes
```

```
Better than Singly Linked Lists for finding nodes and can be done in half the time!
```

```
However, they do take up more memory considering the extra pointer
```

```
Doubly linked lists are used to implement other data structures
and certain types of caches
```
