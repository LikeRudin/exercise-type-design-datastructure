# Heap

# Objectives

1. Define:  what a binary heap is

2. Compare and contrast: min and max heaps

3. Implement: basic methods on heaps

4. Understand:  where heaps are used in the real world and what other data structures can be constructed from heaps 


# 1. WHAT IS A BINARY HEAP?

Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules!

In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. 

In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

### Why do we need to know this?

Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues, which are very commonly used data structures

They are also used quite a bit, with graph traversal algorithms

### MAX BINARY HEAP

```
- Each parent has at most two child nodes

- The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes

- In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.

- A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first
```

# 3. Implements

## Max Binary Heap Class

```
Class Name:

       MaxBinaryHeap

Properties:

       values = []
```

## methods

### insert

```
- Push the value into the values property on the heap

- Bubble the value up to its correct spot!
```
```
- Push the value into the values property on the heap

- Bubble Up:

    - Create a variable called index which is the length of the values property - 1

    - Create a variable called parentIndex which is the floor of (index-1)/2

    - Keep looping as long as the values element at the parentIndex is less than the values element at the child index
        
        - Swap the value of the values element at the parentIndex with the value of the element property at the child index

        - Set the index to be the parentIndex, and start over
    ```

### remove

```

- Remove the root

- Replace with the most recently added

- Adjust (sink down)

what is sink down

    The procedure for deleting the root from the heap (effectively extracting the maximum element in a max-heap or the minimum element in a min-heap) and restoring the properties is called down-heap 
    
    (also known as bubble-down, percolate-down, sift-down, trickle down, heapify-down, cascade-down, and extract-min/max).
```

```
- Swap the first value in the values property with the last one

- Pop from the values property, so you can return the value at the end.

- Have the new root "sink down" to the correct spot...â€‹

    - Your parent index starts at 0 (the root)

    - Find the index of the left child: 2 * index + 1 (make sure its not out of bounds)

    - Find the index of the right child: 2*index + 2 (make sure its not out of bounds)

    - If the left or right child is greater than the element...swap. If both left and right children are larger, swap with the largest child.

    - The child index you swapped to now becomes the new parent index.  

    - Keep looping and swapping until neither child is larger than the element.

    - Return the old root!
